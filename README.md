# Sandesh_OR_German_Shepherd
Convolutional neural network which classifies the images of Sandesh and German Shepherd.
The Dogs images are downloaded from the http://image-net.org/download. The Sandesh images are downloded from my own collection from Photos. 

There are around 100 images including the training data and validation data for each class.

I have used the CNN as well as 'InceptionV3' both. 
 
This model could be impoved by feeding a huge amount of images with a lot of variation. 
 
**Libraires Used: Numpy, Keras, Tenserflow, Matplotlib etc.
